Solutions for the [7th Marathon of Parallel Programming](http://regulus.pcs.usp.br/marathon/12/).

These programs were implemented as part of the [Concurrent and Distributed Systems Lab](http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/fakultaeten/fakultaet_informatik/sysa/se/teaching/courses/ss/concurrent_and_distributed_systems_lab) for the Summer Semester 2014.

All the programs have been implemented in the [Go Programming Language](http://golang.org/)
